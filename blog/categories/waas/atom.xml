    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s continue on WAAS (workflow-as-a-service). In this post I&rsquo;m going
to show how to use parsers combinators to parse our workflow
definitions.</p>

<p>Have a look at sample workflow definition file we&rsquo;re going to parse. It
contains 2 worflow definitions &ndash; one for issue tracking system and other
for deals.</p>

<p>```
workflow issue {
  start state open</p>

<pre><code>             goes to started;
</code></pre>

<p>  state started  goes to open, resolved;
  state resolved goes to closed, open;
  state closed;
};</p>

<p>workflow project {
  start state negotiation</p>

<pre><code>           goes to signed, failed;
</code></pre>

<p>  state signed goes to failed, done;
  state done   goes to paid, failed;
  state paid;
  state failed;
};
```</p>

<p>At the end of this post we&rsquo;re going to have a parser, which transforms
textual definitions to our internal model, ready for persistense.</p>

<h2>Parsers in ANTLR</h2>

<p>To target that task, let&rsquo;s start with something more conventional than
Scala parsers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">EBNF</a> format is widely used for describing grammar, so
we&rsquo;re going to start with that:
<code>
goes       = 'goes', ws, 'to', ws, { identifier, ',', ws }, identifier;
state      = [ 'start', ws ], 'state', ws, goes, ws, ';'
workflow   = 'workflow', ws, identifier, ws, '{', ws, { state, ws },  ws, '}', ws, ';'
workflows  = { workflow }
ws         = ? whitespace characters ?
identifier = letter { letter | number | '_' }
</code></p>

<p>In order to generate executable parsers, we should define the grammar
in some DSL specific for a parser framework we choose. Let&rsquo;s define a
grammar in <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR4</a> &ndash; well known parser in Java world:
<code>
grammar workflowGrammar;
file: workflowDefinition* EOF;
workflowDefinition: 'workflow' ID '{' stateDefinition*?'}' ';';
stateDefinition: 'start'? 'state' ID goes? ';';
goes: 'goes' 'to' (ID',')* ID;
ID: [a-zA-Z]([a-z0-9_])* ;
WS: [ \t\r\n]+ -&gt; skip;
</code>
Based on that grammar we are ready to generate lexer and parser. For
ones who are not familiar with those terms &ndash; lexer is a converter from
input stream to stream of tokens and parser is converter from a stream
of tokens to a parse tree. Anyway, this distinction is not critical in
our case, so I will refer to lexer+parser combination as simply parser.</p>

<p>I leave ANTLR parser generation and execution as an exercise for a reader.
Still, here&rsquo;s sample parsed tree you could view using <a href="http://tunnelvisionlabs.com/products/demo/antlrworks">ANTLRWorks</a>:
```
(file</p>

<pre><code>(workflowDefinition workflow issue {
    (stateDefinition start state open (goes goes to started) ;)
    (stateDefinition state started (goes goes to open , resolved) ;)
    (stateDefinition state resolved (goes goes to closed , open) ;)
    (stateDefinition state closed ;)
 } ;)
(workflowDefinition workflow project {
    (stateDefinition start state negotiation (goes goes to signed , failed) ;)
    (stateDefinition state signed (goes goes to failed , done) ;)
    (stateDefinition state done (goes goes to paid , failed) ;)
    (stateDefinition state paid ;)
    (stateDefinition state failed ;)
 } ;)
</code></pre>

<p><EOF>)
```
You can easily see that this tree is much easier to convert to our model
than a flat string we had on our input.</p>

<p>ANTLR is a great tool and is used in most cases when we need parsing
capabilities in Java world. Anyway, there&rsquo;s a thing you should notice
about grammar definition &ndash; it is so called &lsquo;external DSL&rsquo; &ndash; it means
that this is a separate language, which needs it&rsquo;s own parser and
compiler. If instead we would try to define grammar using Java directly,
it would be a huge pain to write, read and support.</p>

<h2>Parser combinators framework</h2>

<p>Scala goes with it&rsquo;s own parser framework, very much
inspired by Haskell&rsquo;s <a href="http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html">Parsec</a> framework and is a part of standart
Scala library. In a contrast, Scala&rsquo;s parsers are written using plain
Scala using some syntatical features and tricks of a language. This
approach is called <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">Internal DSL</a></p>

<p>Idea behind parser combinators is very simple: every parser is defined
as a function from its input to parse result. Parser result contains
output value or failure message and rest of input:
<code>scala
def parse(input: Input): Result = ???
sealed trait Result
case class Success(result: Output, next: Input) extends Result
case class Failure(failure: String, next: Input) extends Result
</code>
A fact that not-consumed part of input is returned back turns out to be
 a very usefull feature, because it enables easy parser
composition. BTW, composition is kind of fetish in functional
programming community &ndash; ability to define small primitives and compose
larger thing of it is recognized as design success. With that in mind,
parser combinators are definitelly a success &ndash; all parser tutorials
start with creating a parser which parses a single char and than create
much more expressive parsers on top of that primitive. I won&rsquo;t do that
in this post, instead I will act as a parser library user. Anyway, I
strongly recommend reading great <a href="http://henkelmann.eu/2011/01/13/an_introduction_to_scala_parser_combinators">series of posts on that topic</a>. If
you don&rsquo;t afraid Haskell (and you shouldn&rsquo;t!), there are two chapters on
our topic in &lsquo;Real World Haskell&rsquo; book &ndash;
<a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/code-case-study-parsing-a-binary-data-format.html">Code case study: parsing a binary data format</a> and
<a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html">The Parsec parsing library</a>. This is a really interesting stuff to
read &ndash; and I give up explaining parser combinators to that guys.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s create a file <code>src/main/scala/parser/parser.scala</code> and add
following content to it:
```scala
package parsers</p>

<p>import scala.util.parsing.combinator._</p>

<p>object SampleParser extends JavaTokenParsers {
  def number = floatingPointNumber
  def twoNumbers = number ~ number
}
```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start from the beginning. We import all required imports and then
extend our custom object from <code>JavaTokenParsers</code> class. This class is an
extension of default parsers class, <code>scala.util.parsing.combinator.Parsers</code>.
What&rsquo;s useful in that class in our case is that it does whitespaces handling
and provides few useful parsers, like <code>ident</code> or <code>floatingPointNumber</code> we&rsquo;re using in this example.</p>

<p>Launch console with <code>sbt console</code> and have a look at types:
```
scala> import parsers.<em>
import parsers.</em></p>

<p>scala> import SampleParser.<em>
import SampleParser.</em></p>

<p>scala> :type number
parsers.SampleParser.Parser[String]</p>

<p>scala> :type twoNumbers
parsers.SampleParser.Parser[parsers.SampleParser.~[String,String]]
<code>``
Ok, now it should be easier to tell what's going on. Each parser has a type -
what is returned on successful parse. For example,</code>number<code>parser
returns (somewhat surprisingly) String. But what's interesting is a second parser,
which is constructed as a combination of 2 parsers and return</code>~[String, String]<code>- yet
another type to present data tuple. We can use</code>twoNumbers` parser on it&rsquo;s own or
construct more parsers on top of it &ndash; and this is what composition is about.</p>

<p>After defining parsers we can use them. There are 2 methods &ndash; <code>parse</code> and <code>parseAll</code>.
Difference is that second fails if parser didn&rsquo;t consume all the input. Here are some
examples of using that:
```scala
object ParserExample extends App {
  import SampleParser._</p>

<p>  println(&ldquo;Parsing whole string &lsquo;123&rsquo; as a number&rdquo;)
  println(parseAll(number, &ldquo;123&rdquo;).get)
  println(&ldquo;Parsing whole string &lsquo;123 321&rsquo; as a number&rdquo;)
  parseAll(number, &ldquo;123 123&rdquo;) match {</p>

<pre><code>case x: NoSuccess =&gt; println(x.msg)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  println(&ldquo;Parsing string &lsquo;123 321&rsquo; as a number&rdquo;)
  println(parse(number, &ldquo;123&rdquo;).get)
  println(&ldquo;Parsing whole string &lsquo;123 321&rsquo; as two numbers&rdquo;)
  println(parseAll(twoNumbers, &ldquo;123 321&rdquo;).get)
}
```</p>

<p>Go ahead and run this program &ndash; there are 1 failing and 3
successful examples.</p>

<p>So far so good, but how do we convert parser output to types we need? That&rsquo;s what <code>^^</code>
method is for. Let&rsquo;s make our first parser to convert result to float and second
one to multiply floats it parses:
```scala
  def number: Parser[Float] = floatingPointNumber ^^ { _.toFloat }
  def twoNumbers: Parser[Float] = number ~ number ^^ { x =></p>

<pre><code>x._1 * x._2
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>As shown here, <code>^^</code> operator takes parser on a left and a converter function
on a right, and a result is a parser which returns converted result.</p>

<p>If you are afraid of pseudo-graphic operators, don&rsquo;t be &ndash; there&rsquo;s more to come.</p>

<h3>Creating a model</h3>

<p>Before we can parse, I advise to create a model for our workflows, so we have a stable ground
to work on.</p>

<p>```scala model/model.scala
package model</p>

<p>case class Step(name: String, goesTo: List[String], start: Boolean)
case class Workflow(name: String, steps: List[Step])
```</p>

<p>This is just enough to get started.</p>

<h3>Converting grammar</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with creating simple non-converting parser:</p>

<p><code>scala parsers/parser.scala
object WorkflowParsers extends JavaTokenParsers {
  def workflows = workflow.*
  def workflow = ("workflow" ~&gt; ident &lt;~ "{") ~ step.* &lt;~ ("}" ~ ";")
  def step = ("start".? &lt;~ "step") ~ ident ~ goesTo.? &lt;~ ";"
  def goesTo = ("goes" ~ "to") ~&gt; (ident &lt;~ ",").* ~ ident
}
</code></p>

<p>I promised there will be more pseudo-graphics coming. Let&rsquo;s me explain few new things:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>parser.*</code> means zero-or-many combinator, so created parser will be executed zero or many times. In
example, workflows file contains zero or more workflow definitions</li>
<li>strings are implicitly converted to parsers, so <code>"workflow"</code> is actually a parser which accepts &lsquo;workflow&rsquo; string</li>
<li><code>ident</code> is a parser, which parses a Java identifier</li>
<li><code>parser1 ~&gt; parser2</code> means that both parsers are executed, but only result of right one is stored,
so <code>"workflow" ~&gt; ident</code> ensures there&rsquo;s a <code>workflow</code> word before an identifier, but result will
store only identifier value. Same for <code>&lt;~</code>, which drops the right value and stores left</li>
<li><code>parser.?</code> is optional combinator, so <code>goesTo.?</code> means there can be or not be <code>goes to</code> part
in step definition</li>
</ul>


<p>With that in mind, you probably should be able to read through parser definition and see
it&rsquo;s the same we expressed in ANTLR4 grammar. Let&rsquo;s load this into console and have a look at types generated for us.</p>

<p>```
scala> :type goesTo
parsers.WorkflowParsers.Parser[parsers.WorkflowParsers.~[List[String],String]]</p>

<p>scala> :type workflows
parsers.WorkflowParsers.Parser[List[parsers.WorkflowParsers.~[String,List[parsers.WorkflowParsers.~[parsers.WorkflowParsers.~[Option[String],String],Option[parsers.WorkflowParsers.~[List[String],String]]]]]]]
```</p>

<p>Wow, if for simple parser <code>goesTo</code> it&rsquo;s theoretically readable, for top-level <code>workflows</code> parser it quickly gets out of control.
We should use our converter functions to get return result to something more usable. I&rsquo;m going to start with <code>goesTo</code>. First, I&rsquo;ll
explicitly set a type to more desired one:</p>

<p><code>scala
def goesTo: Parser[List[String]] =  ("goes" ~ "to") ~&gt; (ident &lt;~ ",").* ~ ident
</code></p>

<p>If we try to compile that, we will get a compile error. I want to fix it, but I don&rsquo;t want to
write working implementation right away, as I want to use TDD here. So I came for help to <code>???</code>
operator I described earlier:
```scala
  def goesTo: Parser[List[String]] = (&ldquo;goes&rdquo; ~ &ldquo;to&rdquo;) ~> (ident &lt;~ &ldquo;,&rdquo;).* ~ ident ^^ {</p>

<pre><code> _ =&gt; ???
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m writing here &ndash; I want to convert parse result to <code>List[String]</code>, but I&rsquo;m not sure
about implementation yet, so compile this but throw an error in runtime if someone calls this.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to write some tests:</p>

<p>```scala parser/WorkflowParserSpec.scala
package parsers</p>

<p>import org.specs2.mutable.<em>
import org.specs2.ScalaCheck
import WorkflowParsers.</em></p>

<p>class WorkflowParserSpec extends Specification {
  &ldquo;Parser&rdquo; should {</p>

<pre><code>"parse goes to" in { 
   parseAll(goesTo, "goes to one, two, three").get must_== 
     List("one", "two", "three")
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>Note <code>.get</code> method, which is a sneak around type system to give us ability
to take parse result without working on failure conditions. If parse fails, <code>.get</code>
throws exception in runtime, which is good enough for testing. Anyway, in
production code we should use some more consistent approach and I&rsquo;ll go to that in next posts.</p>

<p>If we run a test, we&rsquo;ll receive <code>implementation is missing</code> error, which is exactly what we expected. Let&rsquo;s
now flesh out an implementation:</p>

<p>```scala parser/WorkflowParserSpec.scala
  def goesTo: Parser[List[String]] = (&ldquo;goes&rdquo; ~ &ldquo;to&rdquo;) ~> (ident &lt;~ &ldquo;,&rdquo;).* ~ ident ^^ {</p>

<pre><code> case list ~ last =&gt; list :+ last
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>We saw our non-converting parser returns <code>~[List[String], List]</code> class and it is implemented in a way
it makes possible pattern-matching on that. It makes possible a trick <code>case list ~ last</code>, where
<code>list</code> and <code>last</code> are deconstructed values of parser result. What we need to do is to append
last result to a list &ndash; and it&rsquo;s done with <code>:+</code> list operator. Run a test and it succeeds.</p>

<p>If we load a console once more, we&rsquo;ll notice that not only type of <code>goesTo</code> parser changes, but
of all the other parsers make on top of that:</p>

<p>```
scala> :type goesTo
parsers.WorkflowParsers.Parser[List[String]]</p>

<p>scala> :type workflows
parsers.WorkflowParsers.Parser[List[parsers.WorkflowParsers.~[String,List[parsers.WorkflowParsers.~[parsers.WorkflowParsers.~[Option[String],String],Option[List[String]]]]]]]
```</p>

<h3>Doing other parser</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s convert other parsers.</p>

<p>```scala parser/parser.scala
  def workflows: Parser[List[Workflow]] = workflow.<em>
  def workflow: Parser[Workflow] = (&ldquo;workflow&rdquo; ~> ident &lt;~ &ldquo;{&rdquo;) ~ step.</em> &lt;~ (&ldquo;}&rdquo; ~ &ldquo;;&rdquo;) ^^ {</p>

<pre><code>_ =&gt; ???
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  def step: Parser[Step] = (&ldquo;start&rdquo;.? &lt;~ &ldquo;step&rdquo;) ~ ident ~ goesTo.? &lt;~ &ldquo;;&rdquo; ^^ {</p>

<pre><code> _ =&gt; ???
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>And now let&rsquo;s have some tests:</p>

<p>```scala parser/WorkflowParserSpec.scala</p>

<pre><code>"parse start step" in {
  parseAll(WorkflowParsers.step, "start step name goes to one, two, three;").get must_==
     Step("name", List("one", "two", "three"), true)
}
"parse empty step" in {
  parseAll(WorkflowParsers.step, "step name;").get must_==
     Step("name", List(), false)
}
"parse empty workflow" in {
  parseAll(workflow, """workflow wf {};""").get must_==
     Workflow("wf", List())
}
"parse not-empty workflow" in {
  parseAll(workflow, """workflow wf {
                          start step one goes to two;
                          step two;
                        };""").get must_==
     Workflow("wf", List(Step("one", List("two"), true), Step("two", List(), false)))
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>I know there&rsquo;s a lot duplications and I&rsquo;m going to do some refactoring in my next post.</p>

<p>I encourage you to go ahead and try to fix those tests by yourself. I have created a tagged revision
so it should be easier for you to setup environment:</p>

<p><code>sh
git clone https://github.com/ytaras/scala_waas.git
cd scala_waas
git checkout day1-homework
</code></p>

<p>I also submitted a solution for the impatient &ndash; have a look at tag <code>day1-homework-solved</code>,
anyway you&rsquo;ll learn better if you try to do the homework yourself.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This was a long post. Hopefully, it was useful, as I&rsquo;m going to continue hacking our new and shiny WAAS service.
I&rsquo;m looking forward for receiving comments and questions from you &ndash; and will meet in the next post.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-29T00:00:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://ytaras.github.io/blog/2013/04/29/scala_workshop_0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love Scala. It&rsquo;s combines goodies from JVM and Java infrastructure,
Haskell and dynamic languages like Ruby &ndash; and it almost doesn&rsquo;t inherit
Java programming language deceases.</p>

<p>Anyway, I always wanted to create some end-to-end project using Scala
technologies &ndash; but never did as  I&rsquo;m working with completely different
technology set. So, I decided to come up with some fake business idea
and implement it. I&rsquo;m going to use interesting libraries like Akka and
Scalaz in that task, God help me! I&rsquo;m going to describe things step by
step so people with no experience in Scala can pick it up and proceed
with me.</p>

<p>Here are things I want to try in this project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scala parser combinators</li>
<li>Explicit error handling with Scalaz</li>
<li>MongoDB with Casbah</li>
<li>Functional dependency injection via implicit parameters</li>
<li>Properties checking with ScalaCheck</li>
<li>Concurrency with Akka actors</li>
<li>RIA with Play2 or Lift or JS/Scalatra &ndash; yet to decide</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m also going to focus more on functional side of Scala as I see it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come with following fake &lsquo;business idea&rsquo;: we&rsquo;ll be building a
service, which provides workflow capabilities. You should be able to
submit workflow definitions in textual format and after that create some
objects, assign them to workflows and traverse them from step to step. I
foresee a lot of users working with that service, so I want to do that
as scalable as I can. I will call that stuff WAAS &ndash;
Workflow-as-a-Service, just because W-buzzword isn&rsquo;t taken yet.</p>

<p>You see what I&rsquo;m doing here &ndash; I just came up with a task which requires
Web, parsing, scalability and persistence. Hopefully it will help me and
you to put different pieces of Scala infrastructure together.</p>

<h2>What you should know</h2>

<p>You should be familiar with Scala syntax &ndash; at least not scared with it.
I&rsquo;m not going to explain, what a <code>trait</code>, <code>val</code> or <code>def</code> keyword means.
If you want to read some introductory stuff &ndash; I can recommend  <a href="http://www.codecommit.com/blog/scala/roundup-scala-for-java-refugees">Scala for Java refugees</a> or <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour">Another tour of Scala</a>.</p>

<h2>Starting</h2>

<p>If you are familiar with Scala infrastructure, you may skip the rest of
this post &ndash; I will talk a bit about SBT, Specs2 and ScalaCheck here.</p>

<p>So, de-facto standard in building Scala project is <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">Simple Build Tool</a>.
Go ahead and install it using site instructions. Also I
recommend to install JDK 7 &ndash; OpenJDK or Oracle. Once you&rsquo;ve
done, you should be able to launch sbt:</p>

<p><code>
$ sbt
Detected sbt version 0.12.2
Starting sbt: invoke with -help for other options
/home/ytaras/projects/scala/waas_blog doesn't appear to be an sbt
project.
If you want to start sbt anyway, run:
  /home/ytaras/bin/sbt -sbt-create
</code></p>

<p>Nice! It says we don&rsquo;t have a project definition here, so we should go
ahead and create one:</p>

<p>```
$ mkdir project
$ cat > project.sbt
scalaVersion := &ldquo;2.10.1&rdquo;</p>

<p>resolvers ++= Seq(&ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; at &ldquo;<a href="http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots">http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</a>&rdquo;,</p>

<pre><code>              "releases"  at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases")
</code></pre>

<p>^C
```</p>

<p>Now you should be able to run <code>sbt console</code> and get Scala console
running. It can take some time as it downloads Scala 2.10.1 binaries.
So far we didn&rsquo;t do anything interesting &ndash; we just specified Scala
version to use and added few OSS repositories to be able to access most
Scala libs in future. Now lets try some TDD cycle.</p>

<p>After trying Scala test frameworks my personal favorite is Specs2
mutable specifications. Even if it is said that default BDD approach
for Spec2 should be preferred over unit testing, it goes much closer to my JUnit and
RSpec experience but still has nice integration with some other libs.</p>

<p>So, lets add Specs2 dependency to our project file:</p>

<p>```scala project.sbt
  libraryDependencies ++= Seq(</p>

<pre><code>  "org.specs2" %% "specs2" % "1.14" % "test"
</code></pre>

<p>  )
```</p>

<p>If you are familiar with Maven or Apache Ivy, you can get whats going on
here &ndash; you&rsquo;re specifying a group, lib and version and put that into
&lsquo;test&rsquo; configuration. Notice that double % is not a typo &ndash; it&rsquo;s a SBT
hack to overcome Scala&rsquo;s binary incompatibility between versions. Long
story short, every Scala lib tends to have compiled versions for every
recent Scala version and %% operator picks one based on the current
Scala you are running on.</p>

<p>If you have SBT console (that one, which is opened with <code>sbt</code> command,
not a Scala console, which is issued by <code>sbt console</code>), you can hit
<code>reload</code> there to pick up new project definition. If not &ndash; you can just
open new SBT shell and will be done for you. Now try typing <code>test</code> into
SBT console &ndash; it will download binaries if needed, try to compile
non-existing product and test files and will gracefully shut down with
message about no found tests. Nice! This is your first green build. It
is said, that ideal code is no code, so now you have ideal project done
:)</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s start continuous testing &ndash; run <code>~ test</code> in SBT shell. It will
monitor your source files and relaunch test suite once you saved your
code. Let&rsquo;s add first test file <code>src/test/scala/CalculatorSpec.scala</code></p>

<p>```scala src/test/scala/CalculatorSpec.scala
import org.specs2.mutable._</p>

<p>class CalculatorSpec extends Specification {
}
```</p>

<p>Nothing special is going on here &ndash; adding necessary imports and
extending specific class. Let&rsquo;s add a first specification. Scala
language features made possible fluent specs declarations similar to RSpec:</p>

<p>```scala src/test/scala/CalculatorSpec.scala
  &ldquo;Native scala operations&rdquo; should {</p>

<pre><code>"add" in { 2 + 2 must_== 4 }
"subtract" in { 5 - 4 must_== 1 }
"mutliply" in { 3 * 4 must_== 12 }
"divide" in { 10 / 2 must_== 5 }
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>When you save file you should notice pretty-printed specs with success
message. As a side-note, what we done here is a useful TDD technique
which I call &lsquo;wrapping 3rdparty object&rsquo; (if you know widely adopted
name, please let me know). Idea here is that we write unit tests for
3rd-party components, which we don&rsquo;t write and control, to ensure our
expectation matches it&rsquo;s real behavior. I don&rsquo;t say you should test all
standard lib as I do here, but it may help you if you
unsure what some specific method does in 3rd party library &ndash; write down
a test, make it pass and submit it to your SCM. If version upgrade will
break your expectations (and possibly your code) you will be notified
immediately.</p>

<p>But enough theory. Let&rsquo;s create a calculator &ndash; it&rsquo;s a common showcase
for TDD.</p>

<p>```scala src/test/scala/CalculatorSpec.scala
  &ldquo;Calculator&rdquo; should {</p>

<pre><code>"add" in { Calculator.add(3, 3) must_== 6 }
"subtract" in { Calculator.subtract(10, 3) must_== 7 }
"multiply" in { Calculator.multiply(5, 5) must_== 25 }
"divide"   in { Calculator.divide(30, 3) must_== 10 }
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>That ugly API will be our calculator. If we have a glance at our SBT
shell we&rsquo;ll notice compilation fails. So let&rsquo;s add calculator definition
into <code>src/main/scala/Calculator.scala</code>:</p>

<p><code>scala src/main/scala/Calculator.scala
object Calculator {
  def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = ???
  def subtract(x: Int, y: Int): Int = ???
  def multiply(x: Int, y: Int): Int = ???
  def divide(x: Int, y: Int): Int = ???
}
</code></p>

<p>I really place all that ??? in my code, that&rsquo;s a Scala construct. Long
story short, it&rsquo;s a placeholder for your implementation which has
whatever type you specify but throws exception in runtime<br/>
Scala has very powerful type systems &ndash; comparable to Haskell one&rsquo;s &ndash; so
usually you make use of it and make sure a lot of errors are caught by
compiler. Some techniques exists for that and I will mention them in
future posts. Anyway, with TDD we want to do one step at a time, so ???
placeholder allows to break Red-Green-Refactor cycle into
Red-Compiles-Green-Refactor. Using that in adding 2 integers doesn&rsquo;t
make too much sense, but if we&rsquo;re playing with more complex types
(especially monadic ones) this technique becomes useful.<br/>
If you have a look at SBT console, you&rsquo;ll notice we moved to Compiles
stage &ndash; tests are executed, but exception is thrown. Nice. Let&rsquo;s use
&lsquo;obvious implementation&rsquo; and add, well, obvious implementation for all 4
methods:</p>

<p><code>scala src/main/scala/Calculator.scala
object Calculator {
  def add(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
  def subtract(x: Int, y: Int) = x - y
  def multiply(x: Int, y: Int) = x * y
  def divide(x: Int, y: Int) = x / y
}
</code></p>

<p>I no longer need explicit return types as they are easily inferred out
by a compiler. And&hellip; Tadam! We&rsquo;re Green &ndash; and looks like there&rsquo;s no
need for refactoring.</p>

<p>Anyway, currently are testing only against specific values. Is there a
way to improve a test coverage, add more sample values? That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/rickynils/scalacheck">ScalaCheck</a> framework is for. Let&rsquo;s try to learn it by example.<br/>
First, add it to your dependencies:</p>

<p>```scala project.sbt
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(</p>

<pre><code>"org.scalacheck" %% "scalacheck" % "1.10.1" % "test",
"org.specs2" %% "specs2" % "1.14" % "test"
</code></pre>

<p>)
```</p>

<p>Specs2 provides nice integration with ScalaCheck, we have to import it
and mixin to our spec, so we are able to use helpers in our specs:</p>

<p>```scala src/test/scala/CalculatorSpec.scala
import org.specs2.ScalaCheck</p>

<p>class CalculatorSpec extends Specification with ScalaCheck {
```</p>

<p>Good. Let&rsquo;s write our first property. What about following &ndash;
Calculator.sum should return sum of two numbers it receives as
arguments:</p>

<p>```scala src/test/scala/CalculatorSpec.scala
  &ldquo;Calculator properties&rdquo; should {</p>

<pre><code>"add" in prop { (x: Int, y: Int) =&gt;
  Calculator.add(x, y) must_== x + y
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>If we save a file now, we&rsquo;ll notice that result run has 108 expectations
&ndash; this is because ScalaCheck generated 100 pairs of ints and verified if
  satisfies specified property. Thanks to implicit&rsquo;s black magic we can
use either boolean comparisons <code>x == y</code> or Specs2 matchers <code>x must_== y</code>
whichever suits better. Notice &ndash; we still haven&rsquo;t discovered integer
overflow here, just because we didn&rsquo;t write correct assertions, for
example that sum of positives is positive; but framework silently
generated those edge case values for us. But, as we&rsquo;re
just learning, let&rsquo;s go to something more obvious &ndash; for example,
division:</p>

<p>```scala src/test/scala/CalculatorSpec.scala</p>

<pre><code>"divide" in prop { (x: Int, y: Int) =&gt;
  Calculator.divide(x, y) must_== x / y
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>If we try to run this, it will fail because of zero-division. There are
different ways of handling this. Let&rsquo;s imagine that we say &lsquo;we never
pass 0 as second argument to division, so we don&rsquo;t care what happens
there&rsquo;. It can be easily done with ScalaCheck:</p>

<p>```scala src/test/scala/CalculatorSpec.scala</p>

<pre><code>"divide" in prop { (x: Int, y: Int) =&gt; (y != 0) ==&gt; (
  Calculator.divide(x, y) must_== x / y
)}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you are scared by lot of ASCII symbols and extra parenthesis &ndash; I
encourage you to read ScalaCheck user guide, which is a really nice
description how to write properties. If not &ndash; just believe me that this
property can be read as <em>for any pair of integer such that second
integer is not zero, following property is true</em></p>

<p>That was rather a big post, so I have to wrap up. Hopefully, you have some insight on Scala
infrastructure and building. You can try it on your own, or have a look
at <a href="https://github.com/ytaras/scala_waas/commits/day0">GitHub repository</a>. Also I encourage you to write comments either
here or at GitHub or send to me via Google+.</p>

<p>Next time lets do our WAAS and start from parsing workflow definition
files. Stay tuned!</p>

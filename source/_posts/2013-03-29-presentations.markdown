I want to share two presentations I gave to my coworkers. They cover
concepts I'm actively learning right now - Domain Driven Design,
Command-Query Responsibility Separation and Event Sourcing. Funny, but
when talking about DDD I didn't manage to make it within one hour; so it
gave me good insight about technical presentations - it's not about what
you're going to add to your talk, it's about what your going to remove
from it to focus only on things that matter - and let the listeners to
find out about things you've skipped on their own.

If you see mistakes in those slides, please let me know - I'm still
learning and willing to know if I understand something wrong.
